## üìå Project Overview

This project integrates **financial stock market data** with **ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) ratings** to build a set of **machine learning models** capable of predicting **daily stock returns and volatility**.  

The workflow includes:
- **Data exploration & preprocessing** (`project_explore.ipynb`):  
  Cleaning, feature engineering (returns, rolling volatility), ESG data integration, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
- **Modeling**:  
  Comparison of different ML approaches (Linear Regression, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost).  
  Best models are saved as `.pkl` for deployment.  
- **Deployment** (`app.ipynb`):  
  A **Streamlit web application** where users can input a ticker and visualize predictions, ESG scores, and volatility forecasts.

- **Support decision-making**: Provide insights for investors, companies, and stakeholders.  
- **Understand ESG impact**: Analyze the role of ESG performance on stock stability and perception.  
- **Accessible tool**: Through a Streamlit app, make results interpretable and interactive.
