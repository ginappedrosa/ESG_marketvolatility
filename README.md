ESG & Stock market volatility prediction ðŸ“ŠðŸŒ±ðŸ¤–

Authors: Gina Pedrosa, Erika Pablos, Lielia Rodas

Project overview:

This project combines financial stock market data with ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) ratings to create a machine learning model that predicts stock behavior.

The goal is to provide a comprehensive dataset and predictive model that can be used by:

Investors: To make informed decisions by predicting stock returns and volatility alongside ESG performance, aiming for more stable and responsible investments.

Job seekers or stakeholders: To assess companies with strong ESG values, promoting transparency and confidence in corporate behavior.

Companies themselves: To understand how ESG initiatives might influence stock stability and consider whether investing more in ESG could reduce volatility and improve market perception.

The dataset includes daily stock prices, ESG scores, and derived features like daily returns and volatility, which serve as the target variables for prediction.
